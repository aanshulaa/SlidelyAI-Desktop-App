# Submission Management Desktop App

Welcome to the Submission Management Desktop App! This application helps you manage and view submissions effortlessly. Whether you're handling project submissions, form entries, or any other type of data, this app streamlines the process for you.

Overview
The app is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. It provides two main functionalities: viewing existing submissions and creating new ones. Let's dive into each feature:

View Submissions
Click on the "View Submissions" button to open a form that allows you to navigate through existing submissions. The form includes "Previous" and "Next" buttons, enabling you to move through entries seamlessly. By default, the form displays the first submitted entry, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Create New Submission
When you need to add a new submission, simply click on the "Create New Submission" button. This action opens a form with editable fields for Name, Email, Phone Number, and a GitHub repo link. Additionally, the form features a stopwatch functionality that can be paused and resumed without resetting, ensuring accurate time tracking. Once you've filled in the details, hit the Submit button to send the data to the backend.
